# minwcols 

Variable width columns with a minimum width

The `minwcols`  package implements `C`, `L`, and `R` columns that have a minimum specified width. The package is based on my answer to a StackExchange question: [Specifying minimal (not fixed) width in tabular](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/402414/2693).
